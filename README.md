### SpiVision - Video Streaming site 

####Note:
This is a pre-alpha build, it is missing the following when compared to the actual deployment: 
* it's using the default video player, and missing a jQuery based video player that i put in on the college server.
* it's missing good a background theme, that one of my friend built using photoshop and uploaded directly on server
* it's missing a good 'coming soon' image.

#### If you are trying to use this:
* please replace the sample pencil images, 
* setup the MySQL DB correctly,
* the video location follows tree structure, with every row in table behaving as a node of the tree having the previous and next child information
* admin_upload.php should be able to help you with the uploads
